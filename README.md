 I modified the damage of all weapons slightly as I felt it needed balancing, as well as tweaking the drop chance of certain pickups. I added a laser beam weapon and a "phaser" weapon. The laser beam is a solid beam with low dps but a fast fire rate. The phaser is a slow but wide projectile. I added both weapons to the pickup table accordingly.
